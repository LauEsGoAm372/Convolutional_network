# Convolutional_network

Implementation of image processing and image prediction using Keras' 16-layer deep convolutional neural network called vgg16. Three images are loaded and prediction is performed. In the second part, a more detailed analysis is performed on the Diabetes dataset using Keras and manually.

## **Execution** 

The program is a python script with .ipynb extension, which means that it can be easily visualized in development environments such as visual studio code, colab, deepnote and others.
